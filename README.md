# TRUMPERATOR
MAKE RNN GREAT AGAIN!

Using Tensorflow's framework, we built an RNN that generates a series of Trump tweets given a starting string. We used a database of Trump tweets from 2016 for training and validation. We sanitized and tokenized the data, fed the tweets into the RNN, and then picked a couple of fake tweets that we liked. Finally we built a web app with React and Material UI that keeps track of a user's score as they guess whether or not a series of tweets are real or fake.
